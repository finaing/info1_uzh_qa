# What is this?

This repo contains two files: 

1) an xlsx file with all True/False questions from all available Info 1 midterms and final exams up until HS23, excluding the final exam of HS23.
2) a Python code to print the questions in the terminal and prompt the user to answer.

# How to run

If the two files are in the same directory you can either run the code directly in your IDE or from the command line. 

Thanks to @Lunoastro, the code now has a GUI created with tkinter. Questions can be answered either with mouse press or with 1 or 2 and at the end it will present the user with a percentage showing how good they were.

Please note that the code shuffles the questions for each run.
